      <h2>Robomate</h2>
      <p>The specific problem is the barrier to deploying robotics
and automation for SMEs, enabling them to adapt to the
growing labour shortage and reduce the labour cost per
part. Our challenge is to reduce these barriers by
making an accessible solution and thereby allowing
SMEs to repurpose automation cells without robotic
programming expertise. In turn, this will render our
manufacturing sector more robust, amplifying the
workers’ productivity adapting to the societal challenge
of labour shortage and demographic changes.</p>

      <h2>Why Robomate?</h2>
      <h3>Manufacturing Sector</h3>
      <p>Is critical in Ireland,
contributing up to 37% of GDP
and employing 12% of total
working population</p>
      <h3>Undesirable Work</h4>
      <p>Roles that are physically
demanding, repetitive with
unsatisfactory working
conditions and hence are
unattractive for new workforce
entrants.
</p>
      <h3>Labour Shortage</h5>
      <p>There is a growing labour
shortage in manufacturing with
lack of both skilled and unskilled
labour, particularly affecting
SMEs and threatening their
future success.

      <h2>Solution Development</h2>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>The solution is a software
application that connects to any
collaborative robot (Cobot) and
3D vision system. The software
enables a human to teach
robots manufacturing
operations in minutes.</p>
      <h3>Teaching</h3>
      <p>It reads the robot’s state and
vision data during teaching and
controls the robot’s motion
based on vision feedback
during execution.</p>
      <h3>Non-Experts</h3>
      <p>Through a single
demonstration, a non-expert
user can automate
manufacturing tasks using this
software much faster than
classical approaches.
